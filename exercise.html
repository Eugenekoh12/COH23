        <h2>How can I stick with an exercise program?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Piece your workout together. You don’t need to get all your exercise at one time. Ten minutes morning, noon, and night can give much of the same benefit as 30 minutes all at once.</li>
            <li>Keep it brisk. When you walk, make it brisk, since this may help control weight better than walking at a leisurely pace. What is brisk enough? Walk as though you are meeting someone for lunch and you are a little late.</li>
            <li>Move your feet before you eat. Hit the gym or go for a 20-minute walk with coworkers, and have lunch afterward.</li>
            <li>Try a pedometer. Step-counters (pedometers) are an easy, inexpensive way to motivate yourself to be active. Work up to 10,000 steps per day.</li>
            <li>Turn off the TV, computer, and smart phone. Cutting back on screen time is a great way to curb your “sit time.” Move around instead, by visiting the gym or even cleaning the house.</li>
            <li>Turn sit time into fit time. Try to combine cardiovascular exercise with a sedentary activity that you already do. For example, try doing simple exercises while watching TV.</li>

            <li>Plan exercise into your day. Set aside a specific time in your schedule to exercise and put it in your planner.</li>
            <li>Reward yourself. Set short-term goals—and reward yourself for achieving them. Try targeting a specific event, such as a road race or a walk-for-charity, to participate in—this can help keep you motivated.</li>

            <li>Get a partner. Exercising with a friend or relative can make it more fun. An exercise partner can offer support and encouragement as well aa make sure you stick to your schedule.</li>
            <li>Mix up your routine. You are less likely to get bored or injured if you have some variety in your exercise routine. </li>
            <li>Choose a comfortable time of day. Don’t work out too soon after eating or when it’s very hot or cold outside. If you’re too stiff to exercise in the morning, wait until later in the day.</li>
            <li>Don’t get discouraged. It can take weeks or months before you notice some of the benefits of exercise. If you miss a few days, don’t quit and plan to start again next week or next month. Start again today.</li>
            <li>Forget “no pain, no gain.” While a little soreness is normal after you first start exercising, pain isn’t. Take a break if you are in pain or if you are injured.</li>
            <li>Make exercise fun. Read, listen to music, or watch TV while you ride a stationary bicycle, for example. Find fun activities to partake.</li>
            <li>Track your activity. Keep track of your exercise to stay motivated. Use an app on your phone, a wearable activity tracker or mark down on your calendar. </li>
        </ul>
