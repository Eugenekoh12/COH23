        <h1>Sleep Schedules</h1>
        <h2>Sleep Deprivation and Sleep Debt</h2>
        <p>The amount of sleep a person needs goes up if they’ve missed sleep in previous days. If you don’t have enough, you’ll have a "sleep debt," which is much like being overdrawn at a bank. Eventually, your body will demand that you start to repay the debt.
            We don't really adapt to getting less sleep than we need. We may get used to a schedule that keeps us from getting enough sleep, but our judgment, reaction time, and other functions will still be off.
            </p>
        <h2>Signs of Sleep Deprivation</h2>
        <p>Common signs that you haven’t gotten enough sleep include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Feeling drowsy or falling asleep during the day, especially during calm activities like sitting in a movie theater or driving</li>
            <li>Falling asleep within 5 minutes of lying down</li>
            <li>Short periods of sleep during waking hours (microsleeps)</li>
            <li>Needing an alarm clock to wake up on time every day</li>
            <li>Feeling groggy when you wake up in the morning or throughout the day (sleep inertia)</li>
            <li>Having a hard time getting out of bed every day</li>
            <li>Mood changes</li>
            <li>Forgetfulness</li>
            <li>Trouble focusing on a task</li>
            <li>Sleeping more on days when you don’t have to get up at a certain time</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Effects of Sleep Deprivation</h2>
        <p>Too little sleep can cause:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Memory problems</li>
            <li>Feelings of depression</li>
            <li>Lack of motivation</li>
            <li>Irritability</li>
            <li>Slower reaction times</li>
            <li>A weakened immune system, raising your chances of getting sick</li>
            <li>Stronger feelings of pain</li>
            <li>Higher chances of conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, or obesity</li>
            <li>A lower sex drive</li>
            <li>Wrinkled skin and dark circles under your eyes</li>
            <li>Overeating and weight gain</li>
            <li>Trouble solving problems and making decisions</li>
            <li>Bad decision-making</li>
            <li>Hallucinations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Studies make it clear that sleep deprivation is dangerous. People who missed some sleep before getting into a driving simulator or doing a hand-eye coordination task perform as badly as or worse than people who had been given alcohol.</p>
        <p>Sleep deprivation also changes how alcohol affects your body. If you drink while you’re tired, you’ll be more impaired than somebody who got enough rest.</p>
        <p>Driver fatigue caused about 83,000 car accidents between 2005 and 2009 and 803 deaths in 2016, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>

        <h2>How to Get the Sleep You Need</h2>
        <p>Healthy habits can help you sleep better and longer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep a sleep schedule. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day, even on weekends.</li>
            <li>Create a sleep sanctuary. Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature. Use it only for sleep and quiet activities like reading. Don’t bring in electronic screens like TVs or cell phones.</li>
            <li>Have a bedtime routine. Avoid bright lights, large meals, caffeine, and alcohol before bed. Try things to help you relax, like a hot bath.</li>
            <li>Exercise. Get about 30 minutes a day, at least 5 hours before bed.</li>
            <li>Nap if you must. Aim for no more than 30 minutes so you don’t wake up groggy or mess up your sleep schedule.</li>
            <li>Don’t force it. If you find yourself lying awake, get up and do something quiet, like reading, until you feel sleepy. Journaling may put nagging thoughts to bed.</li>
            <li>Talk to your doctor. A medical condition might be causing your sleep problems.</li>
        </ul>
